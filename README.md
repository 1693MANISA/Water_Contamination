# Water_Contamination
This project applies deep learning techniques to classify water images into multiple quality categories using a Convolutional Neural Network built on top of MobileNetV2. It uses image data stored in class-wise folders and demonstrates the power of transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-tuning for image classification tasks.
